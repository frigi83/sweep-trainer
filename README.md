# Curling Sweeping Trainer

This is my 2020 Christmas holiday project. I am an amateur curling player from Switzerland. Around the World the Covid pandemic restricts the ability to play curling.

This situation gives me the idea to generate a web application to help me (and maybe some others) to do something related to curling at home. This website helps you to train the sweeping at home. You can choose different parameters to personalize your experience.

I am not a software engineer but if you have some ideas or you can write some code, please feel free to do some pull requests.

## Features

- standalone web application, you need only a recent browser
- mobile and desktop ready (responsive layout)
- personalize all parameters (sweeping and pause time, repetition and ...)
- no cookies and no tracking
- host the website on your server

## Next improvements

- improve the website style and my English translations
- pause a training session
- implement the sound of one or multiple skips
- add some brain exercise during the sweeping time
- create a docker container and docker-compose example
